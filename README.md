# [**reADDer**](https://github.com/yesmaybenookay/reADDer)

*A Python script which randomly chooses and prints a file from a directory.*

## Set-Up:

1. Open `reADDer.py` in a text editor and change `/YOUR/PATH/HERE/` in `path = /YOUR/PATH/HERE/reADDer/text/` on line 5 to the directory where you saved **reADDer**.

2. `reADDER.py` will select files from `/reADDer/text/`. It's prefilled with 274 ASCII art text files as examples. Feel free to delete any or all of them and copy your own to this directory.

### Credit:

ASCII art and text files come from:

* [ASCII.co.uk](https://ascii.co.uk/art)
* [ASCII Art Archive](https://www.asciiart.eu/)

### ToDo:

* A better way to set the directory from which reADDer chooses files
* Limit to only text files
* Sub-directory support for better organization
* Stripping of unrecognized characters
* Text formatting including saving text from the chosen file as of list of each line rather than a single string containing the file's entire text
* Other fun stuff with words (a text rearranger/jumbler maybe?)
